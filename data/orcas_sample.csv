2024,2024-10-06,1,100,10:48:00,12:21:00,5580s (~1.55 hours),Mike 1,"Mark Malleson,Joe Zelwietro","K, L",NA,Swiftsure Bank,48.5105018615723,-124.692497253418,48.5263328552246,-124.860000610352,"After Mark’s encounter with members of K and L pod the previous day, he and Joe were eager to take advantage of a rare perfect weather day in the Juan de Fuca and complete another survey. They departed just after 0800 with a full tank of fuel and Fin in tow.
Their aim was to get back to where Mark had found the foraging animals the day prior, southwest of Port Renfrew; the feed had appeared plentiful and it seemed unlikely the whales would have moved far. Sure enough, as they exited the Juan de Fuca westbound, they spotted several fast-moving whales also travelling west.
The first animal they photographed was mature bull L87, apparently the easternmost whale in the grouping, though he was pacing L22 closely. L72 and L105 were travelling just inshore and ahead of them, trailing a large tight group that appeared to contain much of the rest of L pod. This larger group turned out to be a mix of the L4 and L12 matrilines, suggesting that all of L pod but perhaps the L54s were present. They team spent the next several minutes documenting as many of these animals as they could, including all members of the L12 subgroup – L25 was alone ahead of the others leading the westward charge – and all of the L4s.
Based on the behaviour of the animals and their proximity to the apparently rich feeding area from the day prior, along with the absence of K pod, Mark assumed there may be others ahead. The Mike 1 team eased ahead of the Ls and just a mile and a half beyond them, found several spread members of K pod, apparently foraging.
The quickly travelling Ls arrived shortly and joined the cadre of Ks – and as the team soon found, the L54s and L88. K16 and L88 were foraging together, K35 near. K20 and young K45 were not far from them, foraging near K12, K14, K37, K22 and the hulking K33. L87 appeared now alongside L25, and for the next little while Mark and Joe did their best to document each new individual they could. This was made challenging by the somewhat long/deep sounding dives they observed from the animals, though the incredible number of gulls diving for the scraps made relocating them easier. As a whole, the animals appeared robust, and it was good to see such successful foraging for a sustained period.
They ended the encounter early in the afternoon as the group continued their spread foraging behaviour, and began making way east, back into the Juan de Fuca.
The only members of L pod not observed this day were of the L47 matriline (including L83), from which no whales were photographed, as well as L90 and her calf L128. The assumption is that they were not far, perhaps inshore and behind the earlier photographed animals, and when they reached the feeding grounds became too dispersed for the team to detect them. Mark did photograph several members of the group the day prior, including L83 and L90 alongside the clan’s newest addition (see Encounter #99). J pod was not present, and has been observed in the southern reaches of the Salish Sea over the past week.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-100

The team met at Snug Harbor and left on “Orcinus” at 0910. We got on scene at 0930 about a mile off Hannah Heights. L90 and L128 were tight together, as one would expect, and pointed slowly up Haro Strait. Despite early hopes of other whales being around, L90 and L128 were the only two SRs seen in the strait. The pair were near the border but not so close that we couldn’t get the drone up over them. We attempted one photo-ID pass but L90 turned away from us before we could even get within 200 hundred yards. It was clear she was not ready for anyone to be close yet, so we stopped trying and took proof of presence photos from a distance while we flew over them. We were able to get good enough shots with the drone to confirm a right eyepatch, should we need to. The calf was also seen nursing, which is good news.

The next morning, researchers were hoping some whales would still be on the west side of SJI, but the only morning report was of a few whales heading west at Sooke. We had planned an early morning whale search, but this was called off due to “KCB3” having a starboard engine issue. Early afternoon, a couple of whales were seen and photographed at Lime Kiln. Photos posted by Ashley Whitman showed L90 with a brand-new calf. This threw everyone into a tizzy as L90 had never been documented with a calf before, despite multiple suspected pregnancies. We had to scramble a bit to find people and make a plan, as “KCB3” was down an engine. We weren’t the only researchers with boat issues as “Orcinus” was on loan to SR3 due to their own research vessel being out of action. The plan was for Dave to go out in “Orcinus” with John Durban and Holly Fearnbach of SR3 to try to get ID shots of L90 and her new calf as well as getting SR3's drone up and over the mom and calf for their photogrammetry project. Michael, Rachel, and Charli would go out in”KCB3” to see if they could get anything with one running engine. Both boats left Snug Harbor a little after 1400.

L90 and her new calf were in Andrews Bay when we got on scene a few minutes after leaving the harbor. The two whales were non-directional and surfacing irregularly. It looked like it might take a bit of gentle persistence to get the type of ID shots we would like to have when documenting new calves. In “Orcinus”, we launched SR3’s drone since it didn’t seem like we would be getting good ID photos anytime soon. Since L90 was staying under for long periods without going on a long dive, the drone was helpful in letting the boat driver/ID photographer (Dave) know when L90 was coming up. Still, L90 was keeping a distance from everyone, and the calf did not always come up right after her, so getting photos was hard. Around 1525, L90 and the calf began heading slowly down island near Smugglers Cove, tight to the shoreline. L90 was pretty much hugging the contour of the island, even going in behind Sunset Point. “KCB3” headed back to Snug at 1545. While we were able to keep the drone over L90, we were not getting anything more in ID photos other than proof that a calf existed. The pair made their way down to the south end of LandBank when they turned and began to fast travel back up island. We were able to get a decent ID shot of L90, but she was running screen on the calf and the best Dave could get was a tiny dorsal disappearing behind mom. We ended the encounter around 1700 off Bellevue Point, after L90 stopped suddenly and turned down island again. 
While we were hoping for better eyepatch shots of the new calf, the SR3 team got good enough images of it to confirm its existence. This is L90’s first documented calf and it has been designated L128. The calf was not present when L90 was photographed near the Fraser River on September 13th and was probably born the next day sometime. L90 is now our oldest first-time mother at age 31.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-95

We had made it most of the way up towards Point Roberts when we saw a report of whales north of the Coal Docks, so that gave us a little more hope of finding something up there. The weather wasn’t really bad, but it was breezy enough for there to be a 1-2 foot chop. We had made it almost to the main mouth of the Fraser River, when we saw whales and the encounter began at 1034.

The whales were spread out and foraging in the midst of hundreds of sport fishing boats. We tried to go to the northwest edge of the scene and worked the whales on the periphery of the sport fishing fleet. Most of the whales were pointed northeast until they got around the edge of the delta and then turned north towards Howe Sound. We started out seeing mostly K pod whales but members of the L4s, and L47s began showing up mixed in with them. Small groups began forming as the whales emerged out of the boats. Some of the groups seemed social although individual whales were still probably foraging. K45 and L125 were enjoying themselves while they played with one another. K43 was also socializing with the two little ones. K45 breached several times while goofing around. The L72s showed up towards the end of the encounter. L90 was photographed without a calf. We ended the encounter at 1205 off the airport on Sea Island with the whales heading north towards Howe Sound.

The forecast for wind was not favorable, and we didn’t really have enough daylight to make the slog out to the whales worth it, so we would have to wait until morning. SRs were heard on the hydrophones that night and we had a plan to be off the dock by 8am. We all met at Snug in the morning and did make it off the dock by 0806. There was another report of whales heading northeast at East Point at 0745.
After heading through Johns Pass and up Boundary Pass, we passed East Point by 0840. We sighted whales soon afterwards and the encounter started at 0845 east of Tumbo Island. At first, we thought we had multiple pods because it looked like a lot of whales, but it was just J pod spread out abreast in a loose formation. They were traveling slowly north and appeared to be resting. They may have been waking up as the J19s and others moved ahead a little and other groups seemed to ooze towards the west. We made sure we had a proof of presence photo on everybody before we ended the encounter at 0926 a little northwest of where it started.

The whales passed Anacortes, and we got on scene at 1253, north of Shannon Point. There was one small group and some spread out peripheral whales. The main group consisted of T100, T100C, T100F, T37A, and T37A2 and they were pointed west. About a quarter mile north of them, we found T37A4 and T100E milling around together. T101 was also nearby. They formed a loose threesome that headed west before turning southeast back toward the main group who was still heading west toward Thatcher Pass.

T101A and T101B had been reported to have split off to the north and were closer to the south shoreline of Cypress Island. We eventually caught sight of the pair and headed that direction. T101A and T101B were traveling west across Rosario Strait and were loosely spread. They joined up tight once or twice before loosening up again as they traveled toward Thatcher Pass. They passed Lawson Reef and headed into Thatcher Pass on the Blakely Island side. The other whales were also making their way into the pass with most of the whales taking the north side, a few whales in the middle, and T100, T100C, and T100F on the north shoreline of Decatur Island. We moved over to the T100s as most of the other whales turned north-northwest on the Blakely Island side. The T100s turned north off the northwest tip of Decatur Island and passed close to the Frost Island eastern shoreline. The T100s were the westernmost whales while the others were more mid-channel as they turned northwest towards Upright Head on the north tip of Lopez Island.

The whales were mostly in a single tight group although T137A and maybe another whale or two were trailing the others when we arrived. We got the drone up for a couple of flights as the whales traveled east along the south side of Lopez Island. The trailing whales caught up with the group and, other then one jag to the south off Iceberg Point, they all continued east. The other whales besides the T137s ended up being the T36s, T124Ds, and T124A1. The whales were being somewhat social as they traveled.

These whales were identified by vessels on scene as the T35As, a group that we rarely encounter that far east in the Salish Sea, potentially accompanied by the T38As. The team geared up and left Snug at 13:28.

The team arrived on scene at 14:20 just north of Alden Bank. The whales were milling when the team arrived, apparently just finishing processing a kill. As the team slowly approached the area, the whales began moving slowly east. The team took the opportunity to do a left-side photo-ID pass, and confirmed that it was just the T35As present.

After the photo-ID pass, the team moved away from the whales and launched the drone. During their flights, they observed the whales chasing a harbor porpoise. After diving to capture the porpoise, yet another porpoise appeared: a calf! The whales chased and eventually caught both mother and calf. The mother was briefly released, apparently so T35A4 could practice chasing and catching it. The porpoise proved a bit too big for the young whale to hold onto, forcing the adults to step in and finish the hunt.

The whales prey shared and socializing for the next several minutes before again turning directional and heading northeast. As the team got into position for a photo ID pass, the whales spread out over a half mile. The team got a couple more photos of part of the group, but with the light getting lower and the whales spread, they decided to end the encounter at 16:06 and head back to Snug.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-90

Mark confirmed that he was observing members of the T075Bs—specifically T075B2, T075B3, and T075B4. After several minutes, it became clear that prey sharing was indeed occurring, as indicated by a small slick that formed near the whales. Minutes later, the trio moved northwest along the Valdez shoreline, with T075B2 leading the group through the two-foot chop.

Upon arriving at the west entrance of Active Pass, he paused for a binocular scan to check if the whales were still visible. Given the elapsed time, they could have moved south into Swanson Channel or northwest into Trincomali Channel. Enough time had passed that the whales were likely out of his view either way, and the ebb tide would have further helped their progress if they’d opted to move south. 

Mark decided to approach a sport fisher off Collinson Point to inquire if they had seen the whales exit the pass and if they could confirm their direction of travel. The first boat he asked reported seeing the whales heading south towards Portlock Point on Prevost Island just 20 minutes earlier. This information was promising, but once he reached Portlock Point several minutes later and stopped for a scan, the whales were still nowhere to be found. Mark was baffled that he wasn't seeing them; given the recent report and ideal conditions, he began questioning the fisherman's information. 

Just as he was preparing to retrace his route towards Trincomali Channel, another sport fisher who had also been at Collinson Point and overheard Mark asking about killer whales slowed down as they approached Mike 1. Mark approached them for more details, and they informed him that they had seen the whales loop up Trincomali Channel. Mark then proceeded up Trincomali Channel, favouring the northern side, moving slowly and stopping for frequent scans. During his third scan, he heard faint blows to the west but couldn't immediately spot any dorsal fins. He continued toward where he'd heard the blows and eventually stopped a mile to the west. He began to hear the blows again, this time more clearly, and after a quick scan, he finally locked on to the whales! 

There appeared to be three or four killer whales spread out, and it took over 20 minutes before Mark managed to get a photograph of one as they were extremely cryptic - quite possibly the most cryptic whales of the year! The whales would surface 2 or 3 times before disappearing for ~6 minutes. Mark eventually confirmed that he had T023 and a group of three within a half mile, which included her daughter, T023D, and grandkids, T023D4 and T023D5. 

After an hour of starting the encounter, the group of four whales was tight together on the Galiano side of the channel. There was still no sign of the sprouter, T023D3, so Mark decided to end the encounter slightly east of Wallace Island and head towards Porlier Pass in case he was ahead of the group. He also wanted to have a scan for other animals in the Strait of Georgia, as there was an earlier shore-based report of additional animals heading northwest on the north side of Galiano. Mark later received a report on his return from Porlier Pass that T023D3 had appeared along the Saltspring side of Trincomali Channel and managed to photograph him at the west end of Wallace Island.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-87

He was sent a video taken from shore, which revealed the unmistakable fin of T019B, also known as ""Galiano,"" a 29-year-old bull. Alongside T019B were his mother and brother, who had been seen roaming the San Juan Islands and southern Vancouver Island with the T049As, minus the eldest sons, T049A1 and T049A2. 

Mark figured that the commercial whale-watching boats would soon find the whales, so he decided to head back to Victoria. He planned to retrace his route south through Porlier, with a quick detour to the west end of the Secretary Islands for proof-of-presence photos of T023D3 (see Encounter 87) and a bathroom break at Wallace Island for Fin. 

To his surprise, nearly an hour after the South Pender sighting, the commercial whale-watching boats had yet to locate the group. With this update, Mark decided to head toward the top end of North Pender to see if he could find them. As he approached Otter Bay at 1424, approximately 6 nautical miles and 1.5 hours from the original sighting, he spotted the whales along the northwestern shoreline of the ferry terminal! 

Mark immediately confirmed that it was indeed the group of eight whales he had suspected from the video he received when he approached the wide, left-leaning fin of T019B and the uniquely rippled fin of his 23-year-old brother, T019C.

The T36s and T137s were moving quickly along the Orcas shoreline, and we quickly got the drone up over them. During a long dive, the whales turned north towards Barnes Island. The whales were in two tight groups, loosely spread and paralleling one another. The group that was about fifty yards to the west of the other included the T36Bs and T137D while the other group had the rest of the T137s, T36 herself, and T65A5. T36B3 was not present. The western group became the lead group by about the same margin as the whales headed north a little off Barnes Island’s west shoreline. At 1533, members of the lead group briefly began speed swimming at the surface as they rounded the north tip of Barnes Island. That group went into obvious hunting mode in between the north ends of Barnes and Clark Islands.

The commercial boat that sighted them believed they may have seen K26 in the mix. J pod had been reported the previous evening, heading south in the Strait of Georgia near East Point. It was possible that Ks, and perhaps even the Ls, had entered the Juan de Fuca Strait and met up with the Js. Alternatively, it was possible that with the poor visibility, K26 might have been mistaken for the fast-growing J38. 

Mark received a call from Michael, who inquired if he would be heading out on Mike 1 to confirm the identity of the group. By mid-afternoon, the fog had lifted, and reports indicated that the whales were now slightly south of Race Rocks, still heading northwest and angling towards East Sooke Park, so Mark quickly mobilized Mike 1. 

At 1649, while transiting through Race Passage, Mark spotted his first whales as one breached offshore of Church Rock. As he approached, he observed 3 or 4 individuals spread out, moving towards Becher Bay. The first whale he identified was J58, who was foraging alongside her grandmother, J19. At one point, it appeared that J19 caught something and shared it with J58 before they separated and continued westward. Mark then spotted J58's mother, J41, and her older brother, J51. He also noticed what he initially thought was a large male sprouter offshore, which turned out to be 21-year-old J39. 

With no further signs of whales on the horizon, Mark decided to head further south and west in the hopes of locating the leading group. Despite several miles of searching in the middle of the Strait and multiple binocular scans, he found no additional whales. While returning along the Canadian side, within a mile of the Sooke shoreline, he reacquired the original four whales and soon noticed more J pod members appearing offshore, beginning to group together. 

Mark successfully photographed additional individuals: J38, J45, and J37 with her two-year-old calf, J59. He confirmed the presence of J27 but was unable to get a clear photo before J27 went on a long foraging dive. Mark concluded the encounter at 1758, deciding it was time to return to Victoria.

J pod was spread out in singles and small groups while heading slowly southwest down Boundary Pass. J26 and few other spread-out whales got by us and the first group we got on was the J22s with J37 and J59 traveling together. Since we were on the US side of the border, we got the drone up for the first of several flights throughout the encounter. J39 and J49 were traveling together a couple hundred yards behind the J22s and the rest of the J37s. J31, J40, J42, J45, J46, J53, and J56 showed up and all three groups merged into one strung out and loosely spread group.

The day was slightly breezy so we had to bounce our way southwest across Haro Strait. Disappointingly, the whales were reported to have turned around and were now heading southwest. There was some doubt as to whether the effort would be worth it, but we decided to bounce on.

We arrived on scene at 1259 off the southeast corner of Constance Bank. We first saw a group of five that was trailing another larger group about a half mile to the northwest of the trailing group. The trailing group of five did not have anyone watching them so we started there. This group consisted of T117A, T117B, T117B1, T172, and T65A3. They were being somewhat social as they traveled west into sloppy seas. The choppy water meant we saw a lot of chins of surfacing whales but it was hard to catch it when one is stumbling around trying to keep the whales in the frame. We got as good of lefts on this group as conditions would allow before deciding to move on to the larger group. About halfway between the two groups, we saw T49C traveling west-northwest by himself. T49C was taking half minute short dives so it was hard to predict where he’d come up. We got a few shots of him before moving on to the larger group.

The large group was loosely stretched out and were also looking quite social as they traveled west. Several of the young whales were breaching and splashing. This group was being watched by several boats and were moving fairly quickly so we didn’t get that great of pass on them.

Looking up, he saw a small group of killer whales about half a mile offshore, heading in a line towards the Chain Islands. They were prowling through the kelp bed at Lee Rock, heading north towards Baynes Channel. He figured it was likely the T109A2s returning from the Bigg's Bash the day before, as they were identified in the group of about 40 individuals west of Race Rocks. T109A2 and her four offspring have been seen in the area over the last few weeks and seem to have claimed the shoreline between Victoria and Sidney as their territory.

Upon arrival, he confirmed it was indeed the T109A2s. They were moving in a tight group at 5 knots, heading purposefully towards Zero Rock.

Once again, the first two individuals photographed were L83 and L110! They were travelling ahead of but near the K20s and L86s, young K45 and L125 playfully trailing behind their respective mothers. K38 and L106 also shadowed the matriarchs, though not together. It was interesting watching the two lines interact, as both are three-animal families composed of mothers with elder sons and young daughters born 14-15 years later.
As they had later the day prior, as well as frequently during last year’s survey, the spread of whales seemed to be foraging hard in an area for anywhere from 10-30 minutes before charging off in a different direction. Intermittent courtship behaviour was also observed.
After an hour of shadowing members of K pod and the so-called “18 Ls”, the team finally detected some J pod whales along the southwestern edge of the spread, beginning with J31 and J56 foraging near L116. J38 was observed shortly thereafter, shadowing J39 as the younger whale chased down and courted L118 for a few moments. After some excitement above and below the surface, the two parted ways and J39 returned to some nearby J pod members.
The guys wrapped up the encounter after watching several members of J pod capture and perhaps share some prey, before returning to port to rest up for the final day of a so far successful survey.
No members of either the L12 or L54 subgroups were observed; it is possible that they were not present with the large group the Center’s team observed this day, or that they were present somewhere on the periphery of the group.

Dave quickly identified the first two killer whales photographed as L83 and her teenage son, L110…they had found the Southern Residents! Fortunately, the whales were converging into three or four large groups. This made the work efficient, and the team were soon able to identify many members of L pod, including both the L12 and L54 sub-groups, some of the lesser-seen whales in inside waters. L88 was not a part of this large group, though he is generally encountered alongside the L54s.
Unfortunately, L85 was again not observed with his cohort of the L12s, L22 and L25. L87 has for the moment taken his place alongside L22, and we do not expect to see L85 again.

The next large group contained almost all of J pod, the J17s lagging just behind the other 19 animals and a handful of Ks. As J pod has been documented quite thoroughly in Haro Strait and the area throughout June, the team did not linger after confirming the presence of each individual, and moved ahead to the next loose grouping, expecting and finding more of K pod and some of the missing Ls. L88 was near a tight group of K12s. The groups began to splinter as they reached their chosen foraging ground west of Swiftsure Bank, but the team managed to photograph the L55s and K20s, among others.

By the late afternoon, they had photographed every member of J Clan, ending the day how it began, with L83 and L110, this time watching the duo forage as they sauntered west.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-67

Day one was planned only as a transit to Bamfield to get set up, so they were pleased to get a mid-morning report of westbound killer whales nearing Sheringham Point, right on the way!
The team slowed Mike 1 offshore of Jordan River at 1139 and began the first encounter of the week-long survey with four spread killer whales. The first two they documented were T117B and her yearling, T117B1. Nearer to shore, but still over a mile south of the Jordan River outflow, was a large female presumed to be T172. In recent years, T117B – and lately her new little one – has primarily been observed with the T030Bs, but was instead observed the night prior alongside her elder brother T117A and his recent travel partner, T172, in Haro Strait. Sure enough, the third whale was quickly confirmed to be T172. She was initially travelling slightly ahead of the T117Bs, but angled offshore to meet them as they closed the gap. All three then angled offshore, toward Clallam Bay or Sekiu, at which point the guys decided to slowly move inshore, hoping to catch a glimpse of T117A as he made his way out to the others. 
Finding the big bull proved though difficult, as intermittent scans while the T117Bs and T172 were beneath yielded nothing. He eventually appeared nearly a mile northeast of the trio, also beginning to angle out toward the Olympic Coast. The crew on Mike 1 collected several ID shots as he turned offshore, and watched him aim for the others as they ended the encounter and continued their westward travels.
Note: These four whales were observed again the following day by commercial whale-watchers near Victoria, making their three day presence more than any of these individuals were documented in the area in all of 2023 (twice each). These typically rare animals have also been observed in the Salish Sea this year already, in winter and early spring; we are interested to see if this trend continues.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-65

Offshore of those two we found J47 traveling slowly south all by himself. Almost a mile to the southwest of him we found the J19s in a loose group. They were milling and socializing while playing with pieces of kelp. The J19s eventually turned north and headed slowly inshore towards SJI. About three quarters of a mile to the west of them, we found J44, J45, and J49 socializing together in a loose group. J46 joined this threesome and they split into two with J44 and J46 traveling inshore together towards Eagle Point and J45 and J49 continued socializing on their way south. Another half mile to the north of this group, we found the J16s (minus J26) and J53 traveling north together. We ended the photo-ID part of the encounter at 1201 off Hannah Heights and headed back to Snug Harbor for a midday break in the action.

The previous day, several groups of Bigg's killer whales had been spotted: the T037As were westbound south of Race Rocks, the T038As and T075Cs were eastbound off of East Sooke, and the T109A2s had met up with the T049As (less T049A1 and T049A2) near Race Rocks.

After scanning the area with binoculars between Race Rocks and south of Sooke, where Mark also took the opportunity to photograph the flukes of several humpback whales in the central strait, he decided it was time to head back to the harbour. One of his whale watch colleagues had also surveyed the shoreline up to Sheringham Point Lighthouse and had reported only seeing distant humpback blows, confirming the thoroughness of Mark's search.

At approximately 1050, while Mark was travelling east about 3 miles south of East Sooke Park, he received a call from another colleague who had located a large group of killer whales heading west, about one nautical mile south of Beechey Head. His colleague was initially uncertain of the ecotype of whales but Mark quickly arrived and confirmed through binoculars that they were indeed Bigg's killer whales. Specifically, Mark noted that they were two of the matrilines observed the previous day: the T035As and the T049As, minus T049A1 and T049A2.

The group of 10 whales were tightly knit, travelling at speeds between 7 and 8 knots. After approaching to within 50 metres to capture right-side photographs, Mark withdrew to allow his colleague and other commercial whale watch boats to observe without obstructing their view with the research boat. Within half an hour, as other boats departed to view the numerous humpbacks to the south, Mark moved in for one final series of pictures, this time capturing images of the whales' right sides.

Since we had planned for this to be mainly a drone day, we got the drone up for the first of several flights. J36 was foraging by herself behind and offshore of the J19s while J16 and J26 were traveling quickly north inshore. J26 stopped to mill briefly before continuing north.

Next we found J35 and J57 together in shore near Pile Point. After that, the day was a series of individuals and loose pairs spread out between Eagle Point and Hannah Heights. We saw J26 again, offshore this time. We saw J47 by himself, then J42 and J53 loosely foraging together. J44 was also in the area.

Wanting to see whether it was just J pod or if the L54s might still be with them, they decided to head out for a photo-ID survey. They mobilized and left the dock at 1215.

After passing Henry Island, the team soon saw their first blows. These first whales were the females of the J16 matriline: J16, J36, and J42. They porpoised south, travelling very fast. The team got quick proof of presence shots as they zoomed by, and then found their next group.

The team next found a single whale, J41, also porpoising south with purpose. Behind her was J19, who soon caught up and porpoised alongside her daughter. After a pass on these whales, the team moved to a whale they had spotted just behind this pair. There, they found J58, doing her best to keep up with the adults and also porpoising.

The team spotted a tall dorsal fin offshore. They went out into the middle of the strait where they found J39 on his own, keeping a slightly more leisurely pace. After a few shots of him, they moved inshore to a pair of whales hugging the Henry Island shoreline.

These next whales proved to be an interesting pairing of J51 and J40. These whales took a quick opportunity to look for fish off Kellet Bluff, but didn't appear to catch anything. Ahead of them, approaching San Juan County Park, we saw yet another tall dorsal fin, which proved to be J26 travelling on his own.

The team backtracked up the San Juan shoreline, where they found there biggest group of the day: J37 with her calf J59, J46, J31, and J22. These whales also travelled quickly south, but J59 took a few opportunities to breach as they travelled.

The team once again moved offshore to a group they had spotted while photographing the J pod females. They found two pairs, both engaged in vigorous social behavior. Closer to shore was J53 and J56, two young females who, despite not being very closely related, seem to have a very strong social bond. Offshore of them was J49 socializing with his uncle J45.

Even further off, the whales saw another tall fin on. Making their way out into the shipping lane, the team found J27 foraging on his own, but also generally moving south down the strait.

From where J27 was, the team couldn't see any other whales, but a quick chat with Straitwatch confirmed there was another group further inshore approaching Hannah Heights. The team putted that way, where they found J35 with her two sons, J47 and J57, moving leisurely through a tide rip.

The team could not see any whales further up island. They had found everyone in J pod but J38 and J44, and were fairly satisfied members of other pods were not present. With the day getting darker and wetter, and the whales spread out, they decided to call the encounter at 1526 and head back to Snug.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-61

After passing Mitchell Bay, the whales cut into Open Bay, swimming close to the rocks along the Henry Island shoreline, apparently looking for seals but not finding anything.

Based on their trajectory and the time that had passed, Mark calculated that the whales might be on approach to William Head. At 1252, after pushing their way through some unfavourable water, Brendon spotted the first set of fins passing along the shoreline at William Head - just as Mark had predicted. 

The whales appeared to be in a cohesive formation, yet unlike Js and Ks observed earlier, the L pod whales exhibited a varied composition. Initially, the first photographed group included L55, L83, L90, L105, L118, and the L72s. Their movements appeared scattered as the whales were spread out across the entrance to Pedder Bay, but the majority of whales were predominantly southbound against the incoming flood. At 1258, L55 spyhopped near Mike 1’s port side, followed by the other six whales moving southward behind her. Shortly thereafter, another group surfaced behind, consisting of the L77s along with L22, L25, and L87. Meanwhile, the remaining members of the L55s moved in parallel, while the L94s and L47s remained closer to the Vancouver Island shoreline. All matrilines were represented, except for the L54s, who had been traveling with J pod in the preceding weeks. 

By 1300, all whales were clearly southbound against the flood, making slow progress. As the whales moved through the kelp beds between Edye Point and Rocky Point, several members began tail-slapping, seemingly a blend of excitement and an effort to flush out hidden salmon. Their activity heightened further as multiple whales, including L110, L113, and L72, started spyhopping. Meanwhile, others in the pod began breaching and cartwheeling, including L55, L83, L103, L119, and the youngest member of the pod, L127.

Following a final breach from L87 on Mike 1’s starboard side, the pod of 29 whales began dispersing across Race Passage. Mark and Brendon concluded their observation at 1353, noting the whales' departure to the west.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-58

By 1000, Brendon contacted Mark to relay that he was seeing most of L pod from the shoreline, with the exception of the L54s. Following this sighting, Mark and Brendon promptly convened at Oak Bay Marina to prepare Mike 1 for departure. As they were navigating their course into a strong ebb while exiting the harbor, they received a report from Joe indicating that J pod and K pod had been spotted off Seabird Point, Discovery Island. Given their proximity to the location of these whales, Mark and Brendon altered course so as to document Js and Ks in better conditions.

At 1122, many tightly-knit whales surfaced together several hundred metres ahead of Mike 1 along Beaumont Shoals, heading northeast. This group comprised the entirety of J pod, with all matrilines in a tight formation. The most southern subset of whales were the J17s - including sprouting males J44 and J47 - followed by the J19s at the northern end. The pod maintained a steady eastward course towards the western side of San Juan Island, with no observed social or predation behaviour.

At 1130, shortly after photographing the Js, all of K pod began to catch up to the leading whales. Mike 1 remained stationary as J pod continued ahead of them, opting to remain in place for K pod to pass in favourable lighting conditions. Similarly, K pod was also tightly grouped, with exceptions noted for K16 and K35, who were the most eastern whales leading the formation. Among the trailing whales were the K12s, with K37 notably observed sporting a new nick and superficial damage to his dorsal fin. 

With conditions rapidly improving due to the incoming flood tide, Mark and Brendon decided to wrap up the encounter at 1150 AM after a view of the K13s; their aim was to reach the westbound group of L pod whales before the opportunity slipped away.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-57

It took some searching, but the team finally saw whales in the distance between Middle and Hein Bank. The team got in range of the whales at 1153 and started the encounter.

The first two whales the team found were J27 and J39, travelling together back towards San Juan Island. After a couple passes and behavior logs on the two brothers, the team moved off towards a larger group they had spotted to the northwest. There, the team found the J22s and J14s in a tight formation, also heading towards San Juan Island. Also in the area, but more spread out, were members of the J17 matriline: J44, J53, and J46. After a few minutes, these J17s joined in the formation with the other two matrilines.

The team wanted to try to get drone footage of this group, however the seas the whales were in were a bit too rough to safely launch and retrieve the aircraft. The team decided to move inshore where the water was flatter and wait for the whales to get to them. Unfortunately, as the whales neared this calm water, the weather turned and it began to rain, grounding the drone for the time being.

The team decided to move off towards reports of other southern residents near Landbank. Along the San Juan shoreline near Hannah Heights they found J42, foraging on her own. Further north, they found her brother J26, also foraging. A brief break in the rain allowed the team to launch the drone over J26, however the rain quickly returned and forced the team to land.

The whales were spread out, west to east, traveling north in three different pairs. We went to the middle pair first and they were the sprouter T65A3 and the almost sprouting T37B1. These two were socializing and tactile as they charged north in a bit of a tidal lump. They were preoccupied with one another, so we were able to get good lefts and rights on them with little difficulty. A few hundred yards to the east of them we found T34 and T34B traveling together. We got some backlit lefts on them before moving to the final pair and furthest west whales we could see. This was T37B and T37B3 and they were traveling slowly north together about 150 yards to the northwest of T37B1 and T65A3. We got a few rights on those two before deciding to call it quits. While we still hadn’t seen T37 and T34A who we might have expected to be there, the water was lumpy enough to discourage a whale search. We ended the encounter at 1130 about ¾ of a mile east of Mandarte Island. Most of the rest of the T65As had been found earlier somewhere off the east end of Spieden Island in much calmer water. The plan was to head back to Snug, do a quick crew change, and head back out on the T65As for some drone flights. See Encounter 49-2.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-48

The team got the drone in the air, and observed the whales sharing and processing a fresh porpoise kill. The whales milled for several minutes, eating and socializing. T65A2 exhibited the ""moonwalking"" behavior, where Bigg's killer whales will surface in reverse, as he positioned himself to share food with his siblings.

After a bit of eating, the whales shifted behavior and began travelling northeast. The team landed the drone and took on quick photo ID pass on the group. After their pass, the team ended the encounter at 1332 and headed back to the dock.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-49

They had been in contact with us over on San Juan Island so we knew that the L54s and L88 were coming in and making a rare early Summer appearance in inshore waters. After Mark and Joe went home and the whales crossed Haro Strait to the west side of San Juan Island, we gathered the team to see what the whales would do once they were in Haro Strait. The team met at Snug Harbor and left in “KCB3” at about 1316. 

We arrived on scene off Kanaka Bay at 1340. The first whale we saw was a male in the lead who turned out to be L88 and he was traveling north inshore towards Pile Point. We took some left sides on him and then moved back to a loose group of whales that were a couple hundred yards behind. This was a group of Js that included all the J14s plus J26 and J39. This group appeared to be social as they moved slowly north and inshore towards Pile Point. These whales moved up the SJI towards Hannah Heights so we moved offshore to find someone else. There were no whales showing up to the southeast and, about a mile or more offshore, we could only find the J22s and J27 spread out. Other then a few whales plastered to the SJI shoreline, we were having trouble finding any other whales. Proof of presence photos of taken of whales hdg north up the shoreline later revealed the J31s, J35s, J42, J53, and L54, along with members of the spread-out J pod group we had earlier off the north end of False Bay. We were not seeing any new whales although J27 moved inshore off Pile Point. We moved offshore and headed north up Haro around the whales coming up the SJI shoreline. Off of the County Park, we found a single female heading north by herself. This was L54 so we made sure we got some good left side shots of her as she traveled up Andrews Bay. Other whales were being extremely hard to spot in any direction. We thought there might be more whales to the south of us so we went all the way back to Bellevue Point looking for them. Whatever was down there, vanished, so we headed back north yet again.

Off CWR, two whales showed up from offshore and were socializing together. This was the two young males J51 and L117 and we made sure we got good lefts on them too. L54 also showed up again and was nearby. J51 and L117 began milling and then turned toward the boat. We looked down and saw a good-sized salmon swim right over to the stern with J51 and L117 in a slow pursuit. They slow chased the fish around the port side of the boat and looked like they caught it off our bow. More whales must have gone north than we thought since whales were beginning show up out of the woodwork from the north while we were off Smugglers Cove. J27 showed up and he was heading slowly south. L88 also reappeared and he was milling around in Mitchell Bay. The J37s passed us heading south fairly quickly. J26 showed up and he joined L88 and the two of them milled around together between the south end of Mitchell Bay and CWR. They moved inshore so we moved offshore a little but were not seeing a whole lot of whales out there. We saw J39 again slowly heading south. We then saw some splashes up towards Kellett Bluff and this turned out to be the J19s who were porpoising southeast in a loose group. A little behind and offshore of them, J42 and J53 passed us on the backlit side heading southeast at a medium pace. We decided to call it since we weren’t seeing any more whales that weren’t already to the south of us. As we were heading slowly in, one last group over a mile behind us to the northwest caught our eye. We decided to see who they were too and it ended up being all three of the L54s traveling together. L108 had finally appeared so we got a few rights on him, his mom, and younger brother as they headed south off Smugglers Cove in a tight group. L108 broke off and moved inshore a little while L88 showed up again and joined L54 and L117. This group of three were traveling due south, tight together about a mile offshore of CWR. J26 and J45 were traveling together about a quarter to a half mile off the reef and L108 was traveling south by himself between the two small groups. We ended the encounter at 1705 a little over a mile offshore of CWR with L54, L117, and L88 still in a tight group heading south.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-47-2

They departed Victoria at 0745 and were seeing distant eastbound dorsal fins just west of the VH buoy shortly after passing Ogden Point.
Even from a distance Mark was confident the animals were residents, and this was soon confirmed as the guys slowed and captured a few shots of J40 and J45, followed closely by the rest of J pod.
All of J pod but the J17s were travelling slowly in a tight formation – the J17s were lagging just behind and offshore – but it was a trailing group of four that caught Mark and Joe’s attention, as they spotted the hulking L88 and his adoptive family, the L54s, pacing the Js east. These four whales were the only J Clan animals missing from the CWR’s recent encounters with them off San Juan Island in late May (see Encounter #44). Mark and Joe spent a few minutes photographing each of them, and watched as the matriline passed as close to Victoria as they’ve likely been in a few years, just a mile south of the Ogden Point breakwater.
The entire group accelerated as they slipped out of the opposing ebb current south of Brotchie Ledge. They took the near-shore back eddy toward Clover Point, fanning out as they advanced, the J16s charging to the lead. As they reached Clover Point, J16 and J42 surged ahead of the rest and angled offshore, though – perhaps in an attempt to flush any lurking fish off the wall of Clover Point – most of the whales passed through the kelp beds along the southwest shore of the point. No predation was observed, but many of the Js lingered in Ross Bay for a few minutes, somewhat surface active, as the L54s caught up and briefly overtook them, slightly offshore.
As the animals meandered indecisively toward Trial Island, J16 and J42 remained in the lead, but dawdled as they waited for the remainder of the J16s to join them before being the first whales to round Staines Point. The others followed in short order, quite surface active as they moved southeast out of the bay and through the kelp bed along the southwest shore of Trial Island.
The guys ended the encounter as the animals continued east, toward Sea Bird Point, and ultimately San Juan Island. They were travelling in much the same composition they were found, with the J16s leading the bulk of J pod east, the J17s the lone matriline apart from the rest, and the L54s shadowing them all, slightly behind and offshore.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-47

Once we gathered the team and met at Snug Harbor, we left on KCB3 at 1005. The Wild Orca crew got out before we did and found the whales about four miles south of Eagle Point so we headed that direction. We arrived on scene at 1035 in that same area to find J and K pods in several large groups pointed northeast towards San Juan Island. The groups may have been mixed when we arrived but seemed to be breaking up. We had the K12s and K13s in a group to the northwest of us while a mixed group of J pod and the K3s were to the southeast of us. A couple of smaller groups of J pod passed underneath us as they traveled northeast towards SJI. J and K pod members soon began gathering in their respective pods with J pod moving almost a half mile to the southeast of K pod.

We stuck with K pod since we had seen less of them in 2024. They took a slightly more northerly track than before and were in a tight, resting formation. We got some good lefts and rights on K pod along with a couple of drone flights before we thought we would move on to J pod who was now about a quarter mile to the southeast of K pod. We moved behind K pod and over to J pod and got a few photos before J pod decided to switch positions with K pod. After a long dive, J pod came up another quarter mile to the southwest of K pod. J pod was still heading north in a single group and began passing K pod up on the outside. It was more convenient to stay with K pod so we got some more photos and a couple more drone flights in. At around 1225, and about a half mile offshore of Eagle Point, K pod angled inshore and began spreading out. At this point, we felt like we had K pod good enough for the time being and decided to give J pod another try. J pod was about a mile offshore of Eagle Point still heading slowly up island. They were in a fairly tight group although a little more stretched out than K pod had been. We made sure we had pictures of everyone before ending the encounter at 1256 with J pod about a mile northwest of Eagle Point. Upon examining our photos after we got home, we realized that K37 had got some new scarring on his dorsal fin since we had last seen him on May 27th. It was just some light tooth rakes but it might result in a small nick or an uneven trailing edge.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-46

It was a nice day, and the whales were too close to ignore so we headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1210. Barely five minutes later we were on scene off the south end of Kellett Bluff and the encounter started around 1215. The whales had not been identified yet but two whales with biggish dorsal fins went down on a long dive off the bluff as we arrived. While waiting for these two whales to resurface, we spotted another group of whales about a half mile to the southwest of us. The two whales we were waiting for eventually came back up again and they turned out to be the brothers T49A2 and T49A3. These two were loosely spread out and pointed north and we grabbed a couple of quick sun-glary rights of them before we moved to the other group offshore. This group was the rest of the T49As (minus T49A1, who was not present) along with T19 and T19B again. This pairing of groups has spent a lot of time in the San Juan Islands during the Spring of 2024. The group was in a mostly tight formation and was heading north about a half mile west of the south end of Kellett Bluff.

Early reports suggested that it probably more than just J pod. The team met at Snug Harbor and left in “KCB3” at 1048. Since the latest reports put the leaders at Discovery, we headed down Haro Strait toward False Bay expecting them to be coming across. We made it to False Bay without seeing anything before heading south offshore of Eagle Point. We were still not seeing anything, and the sighting conditions were good. We figured the whales hadn’t made it across yet so we headed west towards Seabird Point. A freighter had made the turn up Haro around Beaumont Shoal and, as we approached the area, we began to see splashes. We had finally KWs and they were riding the stern wake of the freighter. The encounter began at 1130 near Beaumont Shoal.

The group riding the wake were the leaders and soon broke off and started heading up Haro at high speed. We could see other whales behind the leaders. The lead group was the J19s and they porpoised away heading north on a line towards Andrews Bay. Behind them was a loose group of all the J17s plus J56 on the same line. To the south of this group, we could see more spread out whales which turned out to be the rest of J pod. However, even further to the south, we could see two other large groups that had to be other SRs. We quickly, and rather impatiently, made sure we got a photo of every member of J pod before heading south to a large group. This group turned out to be all of K pod in a tight group heading slowly northeast on a line towards Hannah Heights. We made sure we got some good right and lefts on everybody and then launched the drone. We got three flights in and got a solid forty minutes of the whales mostly in a resting formation. Towards the end of our time with K pod, they began milling a little offshore of False Bay. There was a little splashing and K16 spyhopped. At one point the K12s drifted away from the others and were floating around briefly. K33 had kelp draped across his back. A few of the K12s moved south towards Eagle Point. After a bit, we decided to head that direction to see who ended up down there. 

We could see a whale or two at Eagle Point but we weren’t sure who they would turn out to be. We passed K37 heading south nearshore about hallway between the south end of False Bay and Eagle Point. We found several spread out whales foraging near Eagle Point, including a mom/calf pair that turned out to be L119 and L126! Then, L77 swam by us and then L22 showed up. K37 was seen briefly heading south right off the bluff at Eagle Point. L121 and L127 also showed up and were playing around with one another. L94 appeared inshore of us and L124 made an appearance to the east of us. We were kinda hoping we just had the L12s and, therefore, just a few more whales to find. However, chance proof-of-presence photos taken of a couple of distant whales showed L82 and L91. So now we knew we had the 18 Ls along with the L12s out there somewhere. Our whales near Eagle Point dissipated on us but we saw a pair of socializing whales a little to the north. They were floating around being tactile so it took us a moment to figure out who they were. It ended up being the sprouter L110 and L122. L110 laid at the surface briefly and showed us his healed torn lip that he has had since he was a calf. We were not seeing any other whales close to shore, so we headed offshore of Eagle Point. We found the L86s spread out, out there. L90 was also in the area. The L86s were milling but other whales appeared to be heading westerly. L110 and L122 showed up again, this time traveling with their moms L83 and L91 heading southwest. The L94s (minus L113) and L22 were a little ways to the southeast and paralleling their course. The L77s were also in the area although they never hooked up with the other L12s while we were with them. We spent a little time getting photos on the L11s while another group appeared about a half mile to the east-northeast of us. This turned out to be the L72s, L115, and, somehow, the L91s again. At this point, all whales were heading southwest. More whales were appearing and they were spread out north to south with several spread out groups with tight centers and peripheral individuals. We passed the L82s and L103s on the way to a group that we thought might have whales we hadn’t seen yet in it. We then found L25, L113, L87, and they had joined up with the rest of the L94s and L22. Beyond them, to the southwest, we found L55, L109, and L118 which were the last of the whales we were expecting to find. We ended the encounter at 1655 about five miles southeast of Seabird Point with all of the L pod members present heading slowly southwest. We were confident that the L54s and L88 were not in Haro Strait today. Of the rest of L pod, the only whale we could not find was L85. Since L pod were spread out for most of the day, there is still a chance he will show up later so we won’t have anymore to say about him until we have more encounters with the L12s and a complete census of the population. L85 was looking a little thin in August of 2023 but he was still alive in November. On our way home, we saw from a distance what appeared to be all of K pod in a tight group heading slowly north in Mitchell Bay.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-44

We passed Hein Bank on the east side and continued south a little further before stopping to take another scan. Still nothing. J pod (probably) must have headed west quicker than we thought. We decided to head west and were heading that direction for maybe ten minutes when Flora spotted a killer whale to the northwest of us.

It was a group of four whales that we quickly realized were not southern residents but a group of Bigg’s known as the T73As. This group is not overly common in the area although they have made their appearances over the years. T73A was in Dave’s very first ever Bigg’s encounter in May of 1990. The T73As were in a tight group heading slowly west into a bit of tidal lump. They loosened up a little with two whales traveling slightly behind the other two briefly before becoming a mostly tight group again. The T73As were being cooperative but the tidal lump made photography difficult. We ended the encounter at 1317 about a mile and a half west of where we started. While we with the T73As, J pod was found heading west on Constance Bank. Given the westerly seas, we decided to not try to catch up to them.

The group was reported to include the T146s along with T125A and T128. The T146s are a group that does not show up in the area very often so we were eager to see them. T125A and T128 are a pair of probable brothers who were also rare in the area prior to 2015. Since then, however, they have become quite common visitors in the Spring. Other whales were thought to be present too. The water that day was not very nice and the sky was mostly gray but at least it wasn’t raining as we headed out. 

We arrived on scene about mid-strait off of Lime Kiln at 1120. The whales were in a single loose group as they headed north up Haro Strait. T125A and T128 were obvious, as well as a large sprouter and an adult female that we took to be members of the T146s. The sprouter had a slighter smaller sprouter traveling near him. After a couple of looks we were able identify the smaller sprouter as T65B1 and his mother T65B was there too. With the T65Bs here, it made for a group of ten whales. We were able to get good left and right side passes on them although the conditions were challenging and it was easy to bounce the whales out of the camera frame. Around 1130, another group of whales was spotted almost a mile to the northwest. They were heading southeast when first seen. A few minutes later, we decided to go over and see if we could get a few pictures of them. We headed toward the new group which had been reported to be the T49As along with T19 and T19B. The group we had been with also angled that direction. By the time we got to the T19s and T49As (minus T49A1 and A2), they were charging north about a third of a mile ahead of the other group. The whales were in a fairly sloppy section of water and we only managed to get photos on a few of them before they went down on a long dive. We moved a little ahead to wait for the lead group in a calmer bit of water but they never materialized. The trailing, original group came up again on a line heading directly toward Kelp Reef. When the T19s and T49As finally reappeared, they had turned around and shown up almost a mile to the southwest of us in much sloppier seas. It was not worth bouncing back that direction for a group of whales we had had several times already this Spring so we went back to the original group of the T65Bs, T146s, T125A, and T128. We were able to get some more right sides but we were being slopped around in the trough with both spray and whale blow covering our camera lenses. At about 1215, the whales turned westerly right through all the rocks just south of the Kelp Reef marker. We got a few more lefts but the whales were moving quickly towards washing machine type water so we ended the encounter there at 1225.",27038/DFO SARA 388,https://www.whaleresearch.com/2024-41
